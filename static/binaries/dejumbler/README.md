DeJumbler
==========

DeJumbler helper is very useful for use with the Jumble strip that appears in newspapers

Dejumbler is a program binary (unfortunately I lost the source code) to print out 
words that are anagrams of the input word (letters)
The dejumbler uses the words.txt as input
I created the dictionary by hacking a Linux game (1997) which needed a dictionary
The dictionary was coded up as a word radix tree which I decoded to get my word list
